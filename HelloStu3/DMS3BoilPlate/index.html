    <li> The genre that I believe the platform is for is mainly
         on art, interactive and immersive art </li>
    
    <li> Touch Designer,
         After Effect, RoughAnimator
    </li>

    <li> The program provide us with multiple features similarly
         to the other digital art program however the most unique 
         feature that Wigglypaint have is how the art lines are moving
         which give it a bit more interactivity  </li>

    <li> The moving lines usually resemble animation and what animator 
        usually uses for a more unique and interesting final results ssuch as
        if they uses he platform for cartoon can make it more childish an fun or 
        when it usage is on horror can create an unsettling vibe
    </li>

    <li> The handrawn and moving feature of Wigglypaint </li>

    <li> The ability to control the movement of the artwork so that it's 
        better for different style of art such something that's more chaotic
        or more peaceful </li>

    <li> This will most likely aimed at graphic artists or animator that want
        to create "Animation Boil" </li>

    <li> In my opinion, the movements are too frantic so the more I'm operating the platform,
        the more lightheaded and nauseous I felt, the color choosing is far too
    limited and hard to use </li>

    <li> In my opinion, this idea of drawing can be quite interesting to master as it make the 
        artworks more immersive </li>
