        <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>So for this it's an emotional driven art website that uses flowers
          as paintbrushes, you can click any flowers you feels like it's reflecting
          on your emotion at the moment and draw, this website was created for viewer
          to express themselves basing on the speed of the cursor. This quicker you
          go, the more randomly the flowers will be put which is an interesting way 
          to portray falling leaves while the slower the viewers go, the more thicked
          the brush will put the flowers which can easily became colors and flat shapes 
          to draw. I would love for the viewers to express their creativity with however
          way they seems fit and the more interesting they can do the better</p>
