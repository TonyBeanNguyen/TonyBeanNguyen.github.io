        <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>This game is a puzzle game in which you will have to finish the final artwork by putting
        all of the puzzle pieces in the correct area. Mainly you will have to click on the specific
        puzzle piece to move it in the area that is empty and keep going until the final artwork
        is re-assemble which mean you have finished the puzzle.
      </p>       
      <!-- I've chosen to create a more simplistic game design with the ideas therefore, it doesn't have a home page
       but if I have more time or chose to develop this again, I will try to make a storyline at first for
       the homescreen leading to the game and make the background a bit more interresting as css background
       is quite complicated. I thought of making an aftereffect video t put as background but judging from
       past experience in another course, video background will take too long to load -->
