        <div class="answer3">
          <b>Answer 3:</b>The part that captured my interests the most was definitely the
          changes in elements when you hovered over it, which specifically means
          the part that I spent the most time interacting with because I believe
          it's a reflection on the visual brand image created for Luni

          <b>Question 4:</b>What was the most common action in your two minute
          interaction with the experience?
        </div>
        <div class="answer4">
          <b>Answer 4:</b>The most common actions I did were reading and experimenting with the
          interactions that the designers have chosen to put into the website. I
          was scrolling through to see the full experience of the design and its
          various sections, then I spent some more times on reading the wwritten
          details provided from the pages

        <div class="question5">
          <b>Question 5:</b>What is your impression of the intended primary goal
          of the interactive experience?
        </div>
        <div class="answer5">
          <b>Answer 5:</b>The primary goal by what I've read seems to be showcasing the creative
          work of Luni. It feels like the platform aims to engage potential
          designers and collaborators into learning about their studio, and the
          projects they handle. The website communicates this by putting a lots
          of visual content like the home page and their work which perfectly
          emphasize on what they seeks and provide.

        <div class="question6">
          <b>Question 6:</b> How does the interactive experience communicate
          this primary goal?
        </div>
        <div class="answer6">
          <b>Answer 6:</b>The experience communicates the goal through its 3D design and the
          visuals of their pages. The design choice is exaggerated by being in
          the middle of the whole experience that have minimal distractions
          around. The navigation is simple, and the overall web flow help you to
          understand their services

          <b>Question 7:</b> What is your impression of how the experience
          should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many
          different times)
        </div>
        <div class="answer7">
          <b>Answer 7:</b>To me, I feels like the website should ve visited occasionally as a
          place to seek for collabarations and works. Most likely during a
          specific time span whien you want to join in on some fun design
          adventures or find a job in codes and 3D

        <div class="question8">
          <b>Question 8:</b> How does the interactive experience communicate how
          it should be interacted with over time?
        </div>
        <div class="answer8">
          <b>Answer 8:</b> It suggests repeat engagement by offering multiple sections for exploration
          from the studio, to the carreer to Omada which is a app they've created, etc.
          The way the content is segmented and organized encourages users to come back
          and have a deeper dive into different sections of the platform, whether 
          it's just a closer look at specific projects that they've made or learning 
          more about potential opportunities and career path.
